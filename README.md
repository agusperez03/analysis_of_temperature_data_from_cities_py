This project involves analyzing daily average temperature data from three cities: Buenos Aires, Bogot√°, and Vancouver. The work encompasses various aspects of information theory, including statistical analysis, Markov modeling, entropy calculation, Huffman coding, and channel analysis. Students are required to perform tasks such as calculating correlation factors, creating Markov models of temperature ranges, implementing Huffman coding for data compression, and analyzing an information channel's characteristics. The project also includes a simulation component to study symbol occurrence probabilities in the channel output. Throughout the assignment, students are expected to implement computational solutions, analyze results, and provide interpretations of their findings.
